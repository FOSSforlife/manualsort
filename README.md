# Manual Sort
This will be an app that allows you to enter a list (of anything: books, movies, notes, etc) and compare them one by one, creating a sorted list by the end. 

It does this using a merge sort algorithm that, instead of running in a loop, can be stepped through via user input. The user takes care of comparing each item to the other.

My main use case for this will be to create lists of my favorite albums, but this can be used to manually sort anything.
